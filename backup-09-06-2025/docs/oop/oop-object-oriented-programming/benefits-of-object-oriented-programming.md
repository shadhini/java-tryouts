# Benefits of Object Oriented Programming

1. **Reduced Complexity**
   * By breaking down a large, complex application into small more manageable and easier to maintain objects.
2. **Easier Maintenance**
   * If object is not working properly, we can only focus on that object only.
   * We can fix that object or plug in another as a replacement.
3. **Code Reuse**
   * Once we build and test an object we can use it in other applications.
4. **Faster Development**
