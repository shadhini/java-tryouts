# Interfaces Glossary

#### Comparable Interface

* used for implementing classes that can be compared with each other
* e.g: If we implement this interface in the `User` class, then we can compare 2 `User` objects based on some criteria like last login date. Then we can sort all users based on their last login date.



#### Cloneable Interface

* If you want to clone or copy a class we should implement this interface in that class
