# Multiple Inheritance

## Multiple Inheritance

> Multiple Inheritance -> Class inheriting from **`multiple parents`**.
>
> Java does **`not support`** this feature due to the complexities it brings.

In some programming languages like `C++`, `Python`, a class can have multiple parents.

## Complexities Introduced with Multiple Inheritance

### 1. Ambiguity Problem

Say class C inherits from classes A and B both.

* If both parent classes have a method with the same signature but different implementations, it is ambiguous which implementation class C should inherit.
* If both parent classes have a field with same name, it is ambiguous whether C should inherit only one field or 2 copied of the same field.

### 2. Diamond Problem

Say, B and C both inherits from A. And D inherits from both B and C.

* If A has toString() method and if B and C both has implemented it differently, then it is ambiguous which implementation class C should inherit.
* In Java all classes directly or indirectly inherit from the Object class. Then if multiple inheritance is allowed in Java, it automatically runs into this diamond problem.

âž¡ That's why multiple inheritance is not supported in Java to keep Java simple and robust.
