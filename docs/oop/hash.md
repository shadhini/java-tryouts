# Hash

> **A hash can uniquely identify an object 99% of the time.**

`hash(Object... values)` method of `java.util.Objects` class takes any number of values and generate a hash based on those values. The Java compiler will put these values in an array.

```java
public static int hash(Object... values)
```
