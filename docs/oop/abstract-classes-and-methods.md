## Abstract Classes

Used in situations where we declare a class, but we **`don't wanna`** be able to **`instantiate`** it; i.e create new instances of that class.

```java
public abstract class UIControl { // Abstract Class

    public void render() {
        // Default implementation is empty
        // since how to render each type of UI control (e.g: TextBox, CheckBox) is different from each other.
    }
}
```

* cannot instantiate
* can be extended by other classes; can be use to share some common code across subclasses



## Abstract Methods

```java
public abstract class UIControl {

    public abstract void render(); // Abstract method; only method declaration is available
}
```

When method is declared as abstract, it forces any of the subclasses derived from that class to implement this method.

‚ùó An abstract class does not need abstract methods. But if we mark a method as abstract, we should mark the class as abstract as well.



## Example

Here UIControl is an **abstract** concept.&#x20;

* We can't add an implementation to the render method in UIControl since it's an abstract thing.&#x20;
* The whole purpose of the UIControl class is to provide some common behaviour for subclasses like TextBoxes CheckBoxes.
* In such scenarios we can declare the UIControl class as an **`abstract`** class and then we no longer will be able to instantiate it.
