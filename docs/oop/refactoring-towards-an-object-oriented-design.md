# Refactoring Towards an Object Oriented Design

\[`Recommended`] ✅ Use an IDE  for refactoring instead of manual refactoring.



What are the classes?

* Make sure each class has a single responsibility.



ℹ️ `Constructors` are used to initialise instances.

ℹ️ `Static members` are used only when we need a single instance.

ℹ️ `Final variables` -> cannot change once set



✅ Move all the getters and setters to the bottom of the class.

✅ Keep everything that's not needed outside as private members.
