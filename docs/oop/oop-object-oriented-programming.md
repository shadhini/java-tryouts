# OOP: Object Oriented Programming

## `OOP`: Object Oriented Programming&#x20;

Everything based on the concept of `objects`.

**`Objects`** contain

1. **`Data`**` ``(state)`
2. **`Methods`**` ``(behaviour)`; operations on the data; functions that modify data; Methods change the state of an object.

In object oriented programming, we bring together data and methods that operate on a single object.

***



In OOP, objects interact with each other to perform tasks.

&#x20;  e.g: car&#x20;

* Car has many collaborating objects inside it.
* Almost all of these objects are **`replaceable`** and **`reusable`**.
* If any of them malfunction, technician can replace it with another.

&#x20;  âž¯ Application in OOP is like a car.



## Main Concepts

1. [Encapsulation](encapsulation/) : bundling the data and operations on the data inside a single unit (class).
2. [Abstraction](abstraction.md) :  educing complexity by hiding unnecessary details
   1. metaphor: the implementation detail of a remote control is hidden from us. We only work with its public interface.
3. [Inheritance](inheritance/) : a mechanism for reusing code.
4. [Polymorphism](polymorphism.md) : a mechanism that allows an object to take many forms and behave differently.
   1. helps to build extensible applications
