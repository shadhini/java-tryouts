# Strings \[java.lang.String]

Although `String` is a reference type, we don't have to use `new` operator to allocate memory.&#x20;

* It can be specified shortly as follows.

```java
String message = "Hello World!";
```



In Java, **`Strings are immutable`**.

* They cannot be changed.
* Methods defined in `String` class do not modify the original string. Instead they return new strings
