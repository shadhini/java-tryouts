# Formatting Numbers

`java.text.NumberFormat` class has lot of classes for handling text, dates, numbers and so on.

* This is an `abstract` class; cannot be instantiated; cannot use `new` operator to create an instance of it.

**`NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()`** -> creates an instance of `NumberFormat` class and return it.

* This is a `Factory` method; it creates new objects.
