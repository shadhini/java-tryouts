# Data Validation

## Data Validation

✅️  Use defensive programming if you are developing a framework for others to use or when data is received from external systems or user.

* If you are developing an application, you should have level of trust in your code. Your methods should trust each other. Don't pollute every method with data validation logic.&#x20;
* Perform this kind of data validation only when you receive input from the user or external systems. That is at the boundary of your application. Not within the application itself.
